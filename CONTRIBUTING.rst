Contributing guide
##################

Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
===================================

-   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    `issues <https://github.com/mosra/m.css/issues>`_, but you can contact me
    also any other way.

Code contribution
=================

-   Setting up and using m.css for your own project is described in the
    `documentation <http://mcss.mosra.cz/>`_.
-   Documentation and the website is essential part of the project and every
    larger Pelican theme, plugin code or CSS contribution should be reflected
    there. Documentation and website content is written in reStructuredText and
    resides in `doc/ <doc>`_ subdirectory. Please verify that all your changes
    there do not break the website build; see `Building the site`_ below for a
    guide how to build it.
-   Python code and Jinja2 templates should be accompanied by tests. See
    `Running tests`_ below for a guide.
-   Best way to contribute is by using GitHub `pull requests <https://github.com/mosra/m.css/pulls>`_
    --- fork the repository and make pull request from feature branch. You can
    also send patches via e-mail or contact me any other way.
-   All your code will be released under license of the project (see `COPYING <COPYING>`_
    file for details), so make sure you and your collaborators (or employers)
    have no problems with it. If you create new files, don't forget to add
    license header (verbatim copied from other files) and don't forget to add
    yourself to license header of files you added or significantly modified
    (including documentation pages), for example::

        /*

Building the site
=================

The m.css website makes use of all the m.css features, which means that it also
needs all the possible dependencies, combined. Sorry in advance :)

On ArchLinux:

.. code:: sh

    sudo pacman -S texlive-most pelican python-pillow python-matplotlib
    cower -d python-pyphen # Build the python-pyphen package from AUR

On Ubuntu you need these:

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt install texlive-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra python3-matplotlib graphviz
    pip3 install pelican Pyphen Pillow

Once you have all the dependencies, simply go to the ``site/`` subdirectory and
start development server there. The live-reloading website will appear on
http://localhost:8000.

.. code:: sh

    cd site
    make devserver

Publishing the website with ``make publish`` depends on a few patches that are
not in any stable Pelican release yet (most importantly
https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/2246), in order to have them,
install Pelican from my local fork instead:

.. code:: sh

    pip install git+https://github.com/mosra/pelican.git@mosra-master

Running tests
=============

Each bigger lump of Python code, Jinja2 template markup or JS code has tests.
There are no visual tests for the CSS style at the moment. Run tests:

.. code:: sh

    cd pelican-theme
    python -m unittest

    cd pelican-plugins
    python -m unittest

    cd doxygen
    python -m unittest
    node test/test-search.js

Code coverage needs `coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
Python and `istanbul <https://istanbul.js.org/>`_ for JS. There is no
possibility of getting code coverage for Jinja2 templates, though.

.. code:: sh

    cd doxygen
    coverage run -m unittest ; coverage html
    # open htmlcov/index.html in your browser

    cd doxygen
    node ./path/to/istanbul/lib/cli.js cover test/test-search.js
    # open coverage/lcov-report/index.html in your browser

    cd pelican-plugins
    coverage run -m unittest ; coverage html
    # open htmlcov/index.html in your browser

Test organization: files named ``test_something.py`` take their input from
``something[_name]`` directories, ``name`` corresponds to given test class. In
case of Doxygen, comment-out the line that removes the ``html`` directory in
``__init__.py`` to see all test output files.

The project is built on Travis CI on Linux with Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6;
Doxygen theme is tested only on 3.6 and math rendering is disabled as it's
impossible to get it working on the old Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Build status is over
at http://mcss.mosra.cz/build-status/.
